Code up two (or three if you are doing the advanced extra credit) programs, details are in the GitHub Classroom Readme file, and submit your source code (pointersArePowerful.cpp, linkedList.cpp, and doublyLinkedList.cpp) to your remote repo in GitHub Classroom.

1) pointersArePowerful.cpp 

2) linkedList.cpp 

3) doublyLinkedList.cpp (Advanced: Extra credit)

Assignment: Understanding Pointers in C++ and Linked Lists

Objective: To enhance students' understanding of pointers, memory addresses, and pointer arithmetic in C++.

Description:
In this assignment, you will explore the fundamental concepts of pointers in C++. You will write programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, including pointer initialization, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.

For both assignments, you are required to submit your C++ programs to the GitHub Classroom remote repository. Please adhere to the following naming conventions for your source files:

For the pointers assignment: pointersArePowerful.cpp
For the linked list assignment: linkedList.cpp
For the extra credit (doubly linked list): doublyLinkedList.cpp

Ensure your programs compile and run correctly before submission.

Tasks:

Pointer Basics
Write a program that declares an integer variable a and a pointer p to an integer.
Assign the address of a to p.
Print the address stored in p and the value of a using p.
Change the value of a using p and print the new value of a.

Sample Code:

Pointer Arithmetic
Create an array arr of integers with 5 elements.
Write a program that prints the address of each element in the array using pointer arithmetic.
Increment a pointer to traverse the array and print each value.

Sample Code:

Assignment 2: Implementing a Linked List in C++

Objective: To practice the concepts of dynamic memory allocation and pointers by implementing a singly linked list and optionally extending it to a doubly linked list for extra credit.

Description:
In this assignment, you will implement a basic singly linked list from scratch and perform basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. For extra credit, you can upgrade your implementation to a doubly linked list.

Tasks:

Singly Linked List
Define a Node struct with an integer data field and a pointer to the next node.
Implement functions to:
Insert a node at the end of the list.
Delete a node by value.
Display all nodes in the list.

Sample Code:

Extra Credit: Doubly Linked List
Upgrade your Node struct to include a pointer to the previous node.
Modify your insertion and deletion functions to support bidirectional traversal.

Considerations for Students:

Pay close attention to memory management, including proper deallocation of dynamic memory to prevent memory leaks.
Test your implementations thoroughly with various scenarios to ensure correctness, especially edge cases such as inserting into an empty list or deleting the only node in a list.

These assignments are designed to solidify your understanding of dynamic data structures and memory management in C++. Submit your source files via the course management system by the due date. Happy coding!
